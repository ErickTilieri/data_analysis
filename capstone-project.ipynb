The cofounder and Chief Creative Officer, Urška Sršen, requires the analyst to analyze srmat device fitness data to help find new growth oportunities for the copany. The analyst should focus on one of the preoducts offered by Bellabeat and analyse smart device data to gain insights into consumer's usage of their sart devices. The insights generated by this analysis will be presented to the marketinbg team in order to help them create new campaigns and merketing strategies for the company.\n\n* **Bellabeat app:** The Bellabeat app provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. This data can help users better understand their current habits and make healthy decisions. The Bellabeat app connects to their line of smart wellness products.\n\n* **Leaf:** Bellabeat’s classic wellness tracker can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip. The Leaf tracker connects to the Bellabeat app to track activity, sleep, and stress.\n\n* **Time:** This wellness watch combines the timeless look of a classic timepiece with smart technology to track user activity, sleep, and stress. The Time watch connects to the Bellabeat app to provide you with insights into your daily wellness.\n\n* **Spring:** This is a water bottle that tracks daily water intake using smart technology to ensure that you are appropriately hydrated throughout the day. The Spring bottle connects to the Bellabeat app to track your hydration levels.\n\n* **Bellabeat membership:** Bellabeat also offers a subscription-based membership program for users.Membership gives users 24/7 access to fully personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health and beauty, and mindfulness based on their lifestyle and goals.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Ask phase\n\nIn this phase, we were asked to keep a few question in mind before performing the analysis.\n\n**Questions:**\n1. What are some trends in smart device usage?\n2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\nWhile those questions can't be answered with the data alone, they offer a guideline for external research to further enrich the analysis and the recomendations in the final phase of this project.\n\n**Producing a report with the following deliverables:**\n1. A clear summary of the business task\n2. A description of all data sources used\n3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data\n4. A summary of your analysis\n5. Supporting visualizations and key findings\n6.
